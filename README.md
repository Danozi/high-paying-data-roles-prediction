Project Purpose
The goal of this project was to explore salary data and uncover underlying patterns that might impact whether an individual earns a 6-figure salary. 
While the initial focus was on supervised learning models (e.g., decision trees and logistic regression) with a binary location variable (USA vs. Foreign), the project later transitioned to an unsupervised learning approach. 
Specifically, K-Means clustering was used to investigate how job roles and continent-level locations influence salary patterns.
